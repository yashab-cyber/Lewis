# LEWIS Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by the LEWIS system.

## Log Files

- `lewis.log` - Main application log (auto-generated)
- `security.log` - Security events and alerts (auto-generated)
- `analytics.log` - Analytics and performance metrics (auto-generated)
- `error.log` - Error and exception logs (auto-generated)

## Log Rotation

Logs are automatically rotated when they reach 10MB in size.
Only the last 7 days of logs are retained by default.

## Configuration

Log levels and rotation settings can be configured in:
- `config/config.yaml`
- `utils/logger.py`

## Note

This directory may be empty initially. Log files are created automatically
when the LEWIS system is first run.

## .gitignore

Log files should generally not be committed to version control.
Add `logs/*.log` to `.gitignore` if not already present.
