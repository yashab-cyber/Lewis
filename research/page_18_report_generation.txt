===================================================================

The LEWIS report generation system provides comprehensive documentation capabilities that transform raw security data into actionable intelligence through automated analysis, formatting, and presentation.

REPORT TYPES AND FORMATS

Executive Summaries provide high-level overviews of security assessments designed for management and executive audiences. These reports focus on risk levels, business impact, and strategic recommendations while minimizing technical details.

Technical Reports offer detailed analysis for security professionals and technical teams. These reports include comprehensive findings, evidence, reproduction steps, and detailed remediation guidance.

Compliance Reports address specific regulatory and standards requirements including PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOX, and ISO 27001. The reports map findings to specific compliance controls and provide audit trail documentation.

Trend Analysis Reports examine security posture over time, identifying patterns, improvements, and emerging risks. These reports support strategic security planning and resource allocation decisions.

AUTOMATED ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES

Risk Assessment and Prioritization analyzes security findings using multiple criteria including vulnerability severity, asset criticality, threat likelihood, and business impact. The system provides standardized risk scores and prioritization recommendations.

Finding Correlation identifies relationships between different security findings, enabling comprehensive understanding of complex attack patterns and systemic vulnerabilities. The system groups related findings and provides context for remediation planning.

Remediation Guidance provides specific, actionable recommendations for addressing identified security issues. The system maintains databases of remediation procedures and provides step-by-step guidance for common vulnerabilities.

Impact Analysis assesses the potential business and technical impact of identified security issues, helping organizations understand the consequences of various risk scenarios and prioritize remediation efforts appropriately.

CUSTOMIZATION AND BRANDING

Template Management enables organizations to create custom report templates that align with corporate branding and specific reporting requirements. The system supports multiple template formats and provides rich formatting capabilities.

Content Customization allows modification of report content, structure, and emphasis to meet specific audience needs and organizational preferences. Users can include or exclude specific sections and customize analysis depth.

Brand Integration supports incorporation of organizational logos, color schemes, and formatting standards to ensure reports align with corporate identity requirements.

Distribution Controls provide automated report distribution capabilities including email delivery, secure file sharing, and integration with document management systems. The system supports scheduling and access controls for report distribution.
