4.3 AUTOMATED THREAT DETECTION

===================================================================

LEWIS implements sophisticated automated threat detection capabilities that leverage machine learning, behavioral analysis, and threat intelligence to identify security threats across multiple vectors.

DETECTION METHODOLOGIES

Signature-Based Detection employs known threat indicators and patterns to identify malicious activity. LEWIS maintains comprehensive databases of indicators of compromise (IoCs) including file hashes, IP addresses, domain names, and URL patterns.

Behavioral Analysis examines patterns of system and network activity to identify anomalous behavior that may indicate security threats. The system establishes baseline behavior patterns and uses statistical and machine learning techniques to detect deviations.

Heuristic Analysis applies rule-based logic to identify potentially malicious activity based on suspicious behavior patterns, even when specific signatures are not available. This approach enables detection of previously unknown threats and attack variants.

Machine Learning Detection utilizes trained models to identify threats based on feature analysis and pattern recognition. LEWIS employs multiple ML algorithms including supervised learning for known threat classification and unsupervised learning for anomaly detection.

THREAT INTELLIGENCE INTEGRATION

LEWIS integrates multiple threat intelligence sources to enhance detection capabilities:

Commercial Threat Feeds provide access to professional threat intelligence including indicators, attack patterns, and threat actor information. The system normalizes data from multiple sources and maintains comprehensive threat databases.

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) incorporates publicly available threat information from security research organizations, government agencies, and community sources. LEWIS automatically processes and correlates OSINT data with local security events.

Community Sharing enables organizations to share threat intelligence with trusted partners and community groups. The system provides privacy controls and anonymization capabilities to protect sensitive information.

Internal Threat Intelligence incorporates organization-specific threat information including historical incident data, custom indicators, and environmental context. This internal intelligence enhances detection accuracy and reduces false positives.

REAL-TIME MONITORING

LEWIS provides comprehensive real-time monitoring capabilities:

Network Traffic Analysis examines network communications for suspicious patterns, unauthorized connections, and data exfiltration attempts. The system uses deep packet inspection and flow analysis to identify threats.

System Activity Monitoring tracks file system changes, process execution, registry modifications, and other system-level activities that may indicate compromise. The system correlates multiple indicators to identify attack patterns.

User Behavior Analytics (UBA) examines user activities including login patterns, resource access, and data movement to identify compromised accounts and insider threats. The system builds user profiles and detects behavioral anomalies.

Application Security Monitoring tracks application-level activities including authentication events, error conditions, and suspicious transactions. The system integrates with application logs and security events.
