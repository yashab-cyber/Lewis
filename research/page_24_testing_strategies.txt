6.2 TESTING STRATEGIES

===================================================================

LEWIS employs comprehensive testing strategies that ensure reliability, security, and performance across diverse deployment environments and use cases.

MULTI-LAYERED TESTING APPROACH

Unit Testing validates individual components and functions in isolation, ensuring that each code module performs correctly under various conditions. The testing framework includes automated test generation and comprehensive coverage analysis.

Integration Testing verifies that different system components work correctly together, including database interactions, API communications, and extension interfaces. These tests simulate realistic usage scenarios and identify interface issues.

System Testing evaluates complete system functionality in realistic environments, including end-to-end workflows, performance under load, and compatibility with various operating systems and configurations.

Acceptance Testing validates that the system meets user requirements and expectations through scenario-based testing that mirrors real-world security operations.

SPECIALIZED TESTING DOMAINS

Security Testing employs multiple approaches to validate system security:

Static Analysis examines source code for security vulnerabilities including injection flaws, authentication bypasses, and privilege escalation risks. Automated tools scan all code changes for common vulnerability patterns.

Dynamic Analysis tests running applications for security vulnerabilities through automated scanning, fuzzing, and penetration testing. These tests identify runtime security issues that may not be apparent in static analysis.

Penetration Testing involves manual security assessment by experienced security professionals who attempt to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities in realistic attack scenarios.

Performance Testing ensures that LEWIS meets performance requirements across various deployment scenarios:

Load Testing evaluates system performance under expected user loads, measuring response times, throughput, and resource utilization. Tests simulate concurrent users and realistic usage patterns.

Stress Testing determines system breaking points by gradually increasing load until performance degrades or system failure occurs. These tests identify scalability limitations and failure modes.

Endurance Testing validates system stability during extended operation periods, identifying memory leaks, resource exhaustion, and performance degradation over time.

Compatibility Testing ensures that LEWIS operates correctly across supported platforms:

Operating System Testing validates functionality across different Linux distributions, Windows versions, and macOS releases, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of deployment platform.

Browser Compatibility Testing verifies that web interfaces function correctly across different browsers and versions, ensuring accessibility for all users.

Tool Compatibility Testing validates integration with various security tools and their different versions, ensuring that tool updates do not break LEWIS functionality.
