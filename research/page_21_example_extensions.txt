5.3 EXAMPLE EXTENSIONS

===================================================================

LEWIS includes several example extensions that demonstrate the framework's capabilities and provide templates for extension development. These examples cover common use cases and showcase best practices for extension implementation.

NETWORK SECURITY EXTENSION

The Network Security Extension provides comprehensive network assessment capabilities including:

Port Scanning integrates multiple scanning tools including Nmap, Masscan, and Zmap to provide flexible network discovery capabilities. The extension provides intelligent scan optimization based on target characteristics and user requirements.

Service Detection identifies running services and their versions across discovered network hosts. The extension correlates service information with vulnerability databases to identify potential security risks.

Network Mapping creates visual representations of network topology and service relationships. The extension provides interactive diagrams and supports export to various formats for documentation and analysis.

Vulnerability Assessment performs automated vulnerability scanning using multiple tools and databases. The extension provides comprehensive vulnerability reporting and prioritization based on risk assessment criteria.

The extension demonstrates several key extension development concepts:

Tool Integration shows how to integrate multiple external tools through standardized adapter interfaces while handling tool-specific command syntax and output formats.

Data Correlation illustrates techniques for combining data from multiple sources to provide comprehensive analysis results that exceed the capabilities of individual tools.

User Interface Development demonstrates creation of custom interfaces including web dashboards, command-line tools, and interactive visualizations.

CUSTOM INTERFACE EXTENSION

The Custom Interface Extension provides an example of creating specialized user interfaces for specific use cases:

Web Dashboard creates interactive web-based interfaces with real-time updates and visualization capabilities. The dashboard demonstrates integration with the core framework's data and event systems.

Mobile Interface provides responsive design patterns that enable LEWIS access from mobile devices. The interface demonstrates optimization for touch interfaces and limited screen sizes.

API Integration shows how to create custom APIs that enable integration with external systems and third-party applications.

Notification System implements custom alerting and notification capabilities including email, SMS, and webhook integrations.

REPORTING EXTENSION

The Reporting Extension demonstrates advanced reporting capabilities:

Custom Report Templates show how to create specialized report formats for specific industries or compliance requirements.

Automated Analysis implements custom analysis algorithms that process security data and generate insights beyond standard framework capabilities.

Data Visualization creates custom charts, graphs, and interactive visualizations that help users understand complex security data.
