8.2 Authentication and Authorization

LEWIS implements a robust authentication and authorization framework that provides secure access control, identity management, and privilege governance while supporting diverse organizational requirements and integration scenarios.

Authentication Framework:

1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
   - Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) with authenticator app integration
   - SMS and email-based verification with secure delivery mechanisms
   - Biometric authentication with fingerprint and facial recognition
   - Hardware token support with FIDO2 and WebAuthn standards
   - Risk-based authentication with adaptive security controls

2. Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration
   - SAML 2.0 integration with enterprise identity providers
   - OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support for modern applications
   - Active Directory and LDAP integration for enterprise environments
   - Social login integration with major identity providers
   - Federation support with cross-domain authentication capabilities

3. Identity Lifecycle Management
   - Automated user provisioning with HR system integration
   - Self-service account management with secure password reset
   - Identity verification with multi-source validation
   - Account deprovisioning with automated access revocation
   - Identity synchronization with real-time updates and conflict resolution

Authorization and Access Control:

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - Hierarchical role definition with inheritance and delegation
   - Permission-based access control with granular privilege assignment
   - Dynamic role assignment with context-aware authorization
   - Role mining and optimization with usage analytics
   - Separation of duties with conflict detection and prevention

2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
   - Policy-based authorization with flexible rule definitions
   - Context-aware access decisions with environmental factors
   - Dynamic policy evaluation with real-time attribute processing
   - Fine-grained access control with resource-level permissions
   - Policy administration with centralized management and distribution

3. Privileged Access Management (PAM)
   - Administrative account management with elevated privilege control
   - Session monitoring and recording with activity auditing
   - Just-in-time access with temporary privilege elevation
   - Privileged account discovery with automated inventory management
   - Password vaulting with secure credential storage and rotation

Identity Federation and Trust:

1. Enterprise Directory Integration
   - Microsoft Active Directory integration with seamless authentication
   - LDAP directory service connectivity with secure protocol support
   - Azure Active Directory integration with cloud-based identity management
   - Google Workspace integration with SSO and directory synchronization
   - Custom directory integration with flexible adapter frameworks

2. Certificate-Based Authentication
   - Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) integration with certificate validation
   - Smart card authentication with hardware-based security
   - Client certificate authentication with mutual TLS verification
   - Certificate lifecycle management with automated renewal and revocation
   - Certificate authority integration with enterprise CA systems

3. API Authentication and Security
   - API key management with secure generation and rotation
   - JWT token authentication with signature validation and expiration
   - OAuth 2.0 scopes with granular API access control
   - Rate limiting and throttling with abuse prevention
   - API security monitoring with anomaly detection and alerting

Session Management and Security:

1. Secure Session Handling
   - Session token generation with cryptographically secure randomness
   - Session timeout management with configurable expiration policies
   - Session invalidation with immediate logout and token revocation
   - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection with token validation
   - Session fixation prevention with token regeneration

2. Device and Location Tracking
   - Device fingerprinting with behavioral analysis and risk scoring
   - Geolocation tracking with anomaly detection and alerting
   - Device registration and management with trusted device policies
   - Concurrent session management with limit enforcement
   - Suspicious activity detection with automated response and notification

3. Access Logging and Auditing
   - Comprehensive access logging with detailed event capture
   - Real-time monitoring with suspicious activity detection
   - Audit trail generation with tamper-proof logging
   - Compliance reporting with automated evidence collection
   - Forensic analysis capabilities with detailed activity reconstruction

Advanced Authentication Features:

1. Adaptive Authentication
   - Risk-based authentication with machine learning scoring
   - Behavioral biometrics with keystroke and mouse pattern analysis
   - Context-aware authentication with environmental factor evaluation
   - Continuous authentication with ongoing identity verification
   - Anomaly detection with automated challenge and verification

2. Passwordless Authentication
   - FIDO2 and WebAuthn support with hardware key integration
   - Biometric authentication with secure template storage
   - Certificate-based authentication with PKI integration
   - Magic link authentication with secure token delivery
   - Push notification authentication with mobile app integration

3. Emergency Access and Recovery
   - Emergency access procedures with break-glass authentication
   - Account recovery with secure verification and validation
   - Administrative override with audit logging and approval workflows
   - Backup authentication methods with secondary verification
   - Disaster recovery authentication with offline capability

The comprehensive authentication and authorization framework ensures secure access to LEWIS while providing flexibility, usability, and integration capabilities that meet diverse organizational security requirements.
