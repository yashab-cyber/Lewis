6. IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY

===================================================================

6.1 DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

The LEWIS development process employs modern software engineering practices adapted for the unique requirements of cybersecurity software development, emphasizing security, reliability, and community collaboration.

AGILE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

Iterative Development enables rapid response to changing cybersecurity requirements and emerging threats. The development team employs short development cycles with frequent releases that incorporate new features and security updates.

User-Centered Design ensures that development decisions prioritize user needs and practical security operations requirements. The process includes regular feedback collection from security professionals and usability testing of new features.

Continuous Integration maintains code quality through automated building, testing, and validation of all code changes. The system performs comprehensive security scanning and compatibility testing for every code modification.

Collaborative Development leverages distributed development teams and community contributions through established processes for code review, testing, and integration of external contributions.

VERSION CONTROL AND BRANCHING

Git-Based Workflow manages code changes through a structured branching model that supports parallel development while maintaining code stability. The workflow includes dedicated branches for features, releases, and hotfixes.

Code Review Requirements ensure that all code changes undergo thorough review by experienced developers before integration into the main codebase. The review process examines functionality, security, performance, and documentation.

Automated Validation performs comprehensive testing of all code changes including unit tests, integration tests, security scans, and performance benchmarks before allowing integration.

Release Management coordinates the preparation and deployment of new versions through systematic testing, documentation updates, and community communication.

SECURITY-FIRST DEVELOPMENT

Threat Modeling identifies potential security risks and attack vectors throughout the development process. The team regularly updates threat models to reflect new features and changing threat landscapes.

Secure Coding Practices implement industry-standard security controls including input validation, output encoding, authentication controls, and error handling. All developers receive training in secure coding techniques.

Security Testing includes automated and manual security testing throughout the development lifecycle. The process includes static analysis, dynamic testing, and penetration testing of new features.

Vulnerability Management provides systematic processes for identifying, assessing, and addressing security vulnerabilities. The process includes coordinated disclosure procedures and rapid security update deployment.
