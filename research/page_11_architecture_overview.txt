3. LEWIS ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN

===================================================================

3.1 CORE ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

LEWIS employs a modular, extensible architecture designed to accommodate the diverse requirements of modern cybersecurity operations while maintaining simplicity and usability. The architecture reflects careful consideration of scalability, maintainability, and extensibility requirements.

ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES

The LEWIS architecture is built on several fundamental design principles:

Modularity ensures that system components can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. This approach enables parallel development, reduces complexity, and facilitates troubleshooting and optimization.

Extensibility allows new functionality to be added through a well-defined extension system without modifying core components. This principle ensures that LEWIS can adapt to new threats, tools, and requirements as they emerge.

Abstraction provides clean interfaces between components, hiding implementation details and enabling component substitution without affecting other parts of the system.

Separation of Concerns divides functionality into distinct components with specific responsibilities, reducing coupling and improving maintainability.

Scalability enables the system to handle increasing loads and complexity through horizontal and vertical scaling approaches.

LAYERED ARCHITECTURE

LEWIS employs a layered architecture that separates concerns and enables independent development and maintenance of different system aspects:

Presentation Layer handles user interfaces including command-line, graphical, and web interfaces. This layer is responsible for user interaction, input validation, and result presentation.

Application Layer contains the core business logic and orchestrates interactions between different system components. This layer implements the natural language processing engine, command interpretation, and workflow management.

Service Layer provides abstracted access to security tools and external systems through standardized interfaces. This layer handles tool integration, data transformation, and result aggregation.

Data Layer manages persistent storage, caching, and data access patterns. This layer ensures data consistency, performance optimization, and backup/recovery capabilities.

Infrastructure Layer provides foundational services such as logging, monitoring, configuration management, and security controls.

COMPONENT INTERACTIONS

The LEWIS architecture facilitates efficient communication between components through well-defined interfaces and messaging patterns. Components communicate through standardized APIs that abstract implementation details and enable loose coupling.
