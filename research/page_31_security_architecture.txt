2. Defense-in-Depth Strategy
   - Multi-layered security controls with redundant protection mechanisms
   - Perimeter security with advanced firewall and intrusion prevention
   - Application security with input validation and output encoding
   - Data security with encryption, tokenization, and data loss prevention
   - Endpoint security with advanced threat detection and response

3. Security by Design Principles
   - Threat modeling integration with architectural design processes
