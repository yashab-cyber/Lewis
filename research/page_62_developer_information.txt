EXTENSION DEVELOPMENT

Extension Framework:
LEWIS supports a comprehensive extension system that allows developers to add new functionality without modifying core platform code. Extensions can provide new security tools integration, custom threat detection algorithms, specialized reporting capabilities, or enhanced user interface components.

Extension Structure:
```
extension_name/
├── __init__.py          # Extension initialization
├── manifest.json        # Extension metadata and configuration
├── main.py             # Primary extension logic
├── config.yaml         # Configuration schema
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
├── static/             # Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
├── templates/          # HTML templates for UI extensions
├── tests/              # Extension-specific tests
└── docs/               # Extension documentation
```

Extension API:
Extensions interact with the LEWIS platform through well-defined APIs that provide access to core functionality while maintaining security and stability. The extension API includes:
- Security event management and notification
