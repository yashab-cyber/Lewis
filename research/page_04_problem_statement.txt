1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT

===================================================================

The contemporary cybersecurity environment faces several critical challenges that impede effective security operations and threat mitigation. These challenges form the foundation of the problems that LEWIS aims to address.

COMPLEXITY AND FRAGMENTATION

Modern cybersecurity operations require the coordination of numerous specialized tools, each with unique interfaces, command structures, and output formats. Security professionals must maintain expertise across dozens of tools including network scanners, vulnerability assessments, penetration testing frameworks, and threat intelligence platforms. This fragmentation creates several problems:

- Increased learning curves for new security professionals
- Reduced efficiency due to context switching between tools
- Inconsistent data formats and reporting standards
- Difficulty in correlating findings across multiple tools
- Higher risk of human error in complex multi-tool workflows

SKILL SHORTAGE AND ACCESSIBILITY

The cybersecurity industry faces a significant shortage of skilled professionals, with millions of positions remaining unfilled globally. This shortage is exacerbated by the high barrier to entry created by complex tool ecosystems. Traditional security tools often require:

- Extensive command-line expertise
- Deep understanding of networking protocols
- Specialized knowledge of security testing methodologies
- Significant time investment to achieve proficiency

OPERATIONAL INEFFICIENCIES

Current security operations suffer from inefficiencies that limit the effectiveness of security programs:

- Manual correlation of data from multiple sources
- Time-consuming report generation and analysis
- Inconsistent methodologies across different analysts
- Limited automation capabilities
- Difficulty in maintaining comprehensive security coverage

INTEGRATION CHALLENGES

Organizations struggle to integrate security tools into cohesive workflows due to:

- Incompatible data formats between tools
- Limited API availability for automation
- Vendor lock-in concerns
- Scalability limitations
- Complex deployment and maintenance requirements

RESPONSE TIME LIMITATIONS

The speed of threat evolution often outpaces the ability of security teams to respond effectively using traditional tools and methodologies. This creates gaps in security coverage and increases organizational risk.
