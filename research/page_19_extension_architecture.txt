5. EXTENSION SYSTEM

===================================================================

5.1 EXTENSION ARCHITECTURE

The LEWIS extension system represents a fundamental design element that enables unlimited expansion of framework capabilities while maintaining system stability and security.

ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN

Plugin-Based Architecture enables third-party developers to extend LEWIS functionality through well-defined interfaces and APIs. The system provides clear separation between core functionality and extension code, preventing extensions from compromising system stability.

Sandboxed Execution ensures that extensions operate within controlled environments that limit their access to system resources and prevent malicious or poorly written extensions from affecting core system operation.

Dynamic Loading enables extensions to be loaded and unloaded without requiring system restarts, supporting development workflows and operational flexibility. The system provides comprehensive extension lifecycle management.

Dependency Management handles extension dependencies and version compatibility, ensuring that extensions can rely on specific framework features while maintaining forward compatibility as the system evolves.

EXTENSION TYPES

Tool Integration Extensions enable support for new security tools by providing adapters and interfaces that integrate tools into the LEWIS ecosystem. These extensions handle tool-specific command generation, output parsing, and error handling.

Interface Extensions add new user interface capabilities such as specialized dashboards, mobile interfaces, or integration with external systems. These extensions leverage the core framework while providing unique user experiences.

Analysis Extensions implement custom analysis capabilities including specialized threat detection algorithms, custom reporting formats, and domain-specific security assessments.

Data Source Extensions enable integration with new data sources such as threat intelligence feeds, log aggregation systems, and security information databases.

API FRAMEWORK

The extension API framework provides comprehensive capabilities for extension development:

Core API Access enables extensions to utilize core LEWIS functionality including command processing, data storage, user authentication, and system configuration.

Event System allows extensions to register for and respond to system events such as scan completion, threat detection, and user actions. This event-driven approach enables loose coupling between extensions and core functionality.

Data Access APIs provide standardized methods for extensions to store and retrieve data while maintaining security and consistency. The system provides both relational and document storage options.

Security Controls ensure that extensions operate within appropriate security boundaries and cannot compromise system security or access unauthorized data.
