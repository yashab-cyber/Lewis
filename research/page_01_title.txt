ABSTRACT

This research paper presents a comprehensive analysis of LEWIS (Linux Environment Working Intelligence System), an innovative AI-powered cybersecurity framework designed to revolutionize security operations through natural language processing and intelligent automation. LEWIS addresses the growing complexity of cybersecurity threats by providing an intuitive, extensible platform that integrates over 100 security tools into a unified interface.

The research examines LEWIS's architecture, implementation methodologies, extension system, deployment strategies, and real-world applications. Through detailed analysis of the framework's core components, this paper demonstrates how LEWIS bridges the gap between complex cybersecurity tools and practical security operations, making advanced security capabilities accessible to professionals across all skill levels.

Key findings indicate that LEWIS significantly reduces the time required for security assessments, improves threat detection accuracy, and enables rapid response to emerging cybersecurity challenges. The framework's modular design and extensible architecture position it as a scalable solution for organizations ranging from small businesses to large enterprises.
