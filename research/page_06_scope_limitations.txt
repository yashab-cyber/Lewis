1.4 SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS

===================================================================

RESEARCH SCOPE

This research paper encompasses a comprehensive analysis of LEWIS across multiple dimensions:

TECHNICAL SCOPE
- Complete architecture documentation and analysis
- Core functionality assessment and evaluation
- Extension system design and implementation review
- Performance benchmarking and optimization analysis
- Security architecture and compliance evaluation

OPERATIONAL SCOPE
- Deployment methodologies and best practices
- User experience and interface design evaluation
- Integration capabilities with existing security infrastructure
- Scalability analysis for different organizational sizes
- Maintenance and operational considerations

COMMUNITY SCOPE
- Open-source development model analysis
- Community contribution patterns and growth metrics
- Extension ecosystem development and sustainability
- Knowledge sharing and documentation practices
- Training and certification program effectiveness

RESEARCH LIMITATIONS

TEMPORAL LIMITATIONS
This research represents a snapshot of LEWIS development as of June 2025. The rapid pace of cybersecurity evolution and continuous framework development means that some findings may require updates as new versions and capabilities are released.

TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS
- Analysis is primarily based on publicly available information and documentation
- Some proprietary implementations and commercial extensions may not be fully covered
- Performance testing is limited to controlled environments and may not reflect all real-world scenarios
- Security testing focuses on design principles rather than comprehensive penetration testing

SCOPE BOUNDARIES
- Research focuses primarily on the core LEWIS framework and officially supported extensions
- Third-party integrations and unofficial modifications are addressed but not comprehensively analyzed
- Commercial support offerings and enterprise features receive limited coverage
- International deployment considerations and regulatory variations are addressed generally

METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS
- Comparative analysis is limited to publicly documented competing frameworks
- Performance benchmarks may not represent all possible use cases and environments
- User experience evaluation is based on available feedback and documentation rather than comprehensive user studies
- Long-term impact assessment is limited by the framework's relatively recent development
