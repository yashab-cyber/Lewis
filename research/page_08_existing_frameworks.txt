2.2 EXISTING SECURITY FRAMEWORKS

===================================================================

The cybersecurity industry has developed numerous frameworks and platforms aimed at addressing the challenges of modern security operations. Understanding these existing solutions provides important context for evaluating LEWIS's unique contributions and positioning.

TRADITIONAL SECURITY FRAMEWORKS

NIST Cybersecurity Framework represents one of the most widely adopted approaches to cybersecurity management. The framework provides a structured approach to identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents. While comprehensive in scope, the NIST framework primarily focuses on governance and process rather than technical implementation.

ISO 27001/27002 standards provide detailed security controls and management system requirements. These standards offer extensive guidance on security implementation but require significant expertise to implement effectively and lack integrated tooling for practical application.

MITRE ATT&CK Framework has emerged as a leading knowledge base for understanding adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures. The framework provides valuable threat intelligence but requires additional tooling and expertise to translate knowledge into actionable security operations.

INTEGRATED SECURITY PLATFORMS

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms attempt to centralize security data collection and analysis. Leading SIEM solutions include Splunk, IBM QRadar, and ArcSight. While powerful, these platforms typically require significant customization and expertise to implement effectively.

Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms aim to automate security operations and incident response. Solutions like Phantom, Demisto (now Cortex XSOAR), and TheHive provide workflow automation capabilities but often require extensive configuration and maintenance.

Extended Detection and Response (XDR) platforms attempt to provide unified threat detection and response across multiple security domains. Vendors like CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, and Microsoft offer XDR solutions that integrate multiple security functions but can be expensive and complex to deploy.

OPEN-SOURCE ALTERNATIVES

Several open-source frameworks have emerged to provide alternatives to commercial solutions:

OSSIM (Open Source Security Information Management) provides SIEM-like capabilities with open-source components. While cost-effective, OSSIM requires significant technical expertise to deploy and maintain effectively.

TheHive Project offers an open-source incident response platform with case management and collaboration features. The platform provides good functionality but lacks the integrated tooling and natural language interface offered by LEWIS.

Security Onion provides a comprehensive network security monitoring platform based on open-source tools. While powerful for network security monitoring, it requires significant expertise to deploy and operate effectively.
