# Threat Feeds Directory

This directory is used by LEWIS to cache threat intelligence feeds from various security sources for real-time threat detection and analysis.

## Purpose

The threat feeds directory serves as a local cache for:

- **Real-time Threat Intelligence**: Current threat indicators and signatures
- **IOC Databases**: Indicators of Compromise from multiple threat intelligence sources
- **Malware Signatures**: Updated malware detection signatures and hashes
- **IP Reputation**: Blacklisted IPs, domains, and URL reputation data
- **CVE Feeds**: Latest vulnerability information and exploit data

## Contents

When active, this directory contains:

- **Feed Data**: JSON, XML, and CSV files containing threat intelligence
- **IOC Lists**: Indicators of Compromise in various formats (STIX, JSON, CSV)
- **Signature Files**: Malware and intrusion detection signatures
- **Reputation Databases**: IP, domain, and URL reputation data
- **Feed Metadata**: Information about feed sources and update timestamps

## Feed Sources

LEWIS integrates with multiple threat intelligence sources:

### Free Sources
- **MISP Communities**: Community-driven threat sharing platforms
- **Open Threat Intelligence**: Publicly available IOC feeds
- **Government Feeds**: National cybersecurity center feeds
- **Vendor Feeds**: Free threat intelligence from security vendors

### Commercial Sources
- **Threat Intelligence Platforms**: Commercial TI platform APIs
- **Security Vendors**: Commercial threat feeds from major vendors
- **Industry Feeds**: Sector-specific threat intelligence
- **Premium IOC Feeds**: High-quality commercial indicator feeds

## Update Mechanism

### Automatic Updates
- **Scheduled Updates**: Feeds are updated on configurable schedules
- **Real-time Feeds**: Some feeds provide real-time updates via API
- **Incremental Updates**: Only new/changed data is downloaded
- **Failover Sources**: Multiple sources ensure feed availability

### Configuration
Feed updates are configured in `config/threat_feeds.yaml`:

```yaml
threat_feeds:
  update_interval: "1h"      # Update frequency
  sources:
    misp:
      enabled: true
      url: "https://misp.example.com"
      api_key: "${MISP_API_KEY}"
    otx:
      enabled: true
      api_key: "${OTX_API_KEY}"
  cache_retention: "7d"      # How long to keep old data
```

## Feed Processing

### Data Validation
- **Format Validation**: Ensures feeds conform to expected formats
- **Integrity Checks**: Verifies feed authenticity and completeness
- **Deduplication**: Removes duplicate indicators across sources
- **Quality Scoring**: Assigns confidence scores to indicators

### Data Enrichment
- **Context Addition**: Adds context and attribution to indicators
- **Correlation**: Links related indicators across different feeds
- **Classification**: Categorizes threats by type and severity
- **Metadata Enhancement**: Adds timestamps, source information

## Security Considerations

### Feed Security
- **Encrypted Transit**: All feed downloads use encrypted connections
- **Source Authentication**: Feed sources are authenticated and verified
- **Integrity Verification**: Downloaded feeds are checked for tampering
- **Access Control**: Feed access is restricted to authorized processes

### Data Protection
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Commercial feeds are handled according to license terms
- **Data Retention**: Old feed data is securely deleted according to policy
- **Audit Logging**: All feed operations are logged for compliance

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- **Smart Caching**: Frequently accessed indicators are cached in memory
- **Compression**: Feed data is compressed to reduce storage requirements
- **Indexing**: Indicators are indexed for fast lookup and search
- **Partitioning**: Large feeds are partitioned for efficient processing

### Resource Management
- **Bandwidth Control**: Feed updates respect bandwidth limitations
- **Storage Monitoring**: Directory size is monitored and managed
- **Memory Usage**: Feed processing uses configurable memory limits
- **CPU Scheduling**: Feed updates are scheduled during low-usage periods

## Integration with LEWIS

### Threat Detection
- Feeds are automatically integrated into LEWIS threat detection engine
- Real-time IOC matching against network traffic and file analysis
- Automated alert generation for feed matches
- Context-aware threat scoring using multiple feed sources

### API Access
- RESTful API for accessing cached feed data
- GraphQL interface for complex feed queries
- Streaming API for real-time feed updates
- Webhook support for feed change notifications

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Feed Health Monitoring
- **Update Status**: Monitors successful/failed feed updates
- **Data Quality**: Tracks feed data quality metrics
- **Source Availability**: Monitors feed source uptime
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks feed processing performance

### Alerting
- **Failed Updates**: Alerts when feeds fail to update
- **Quality Issues**: Alerts for feed data quality problems
- **Source Issues**: Alerts when feed sources become unavailable
- **Capacity Issues**: Alerts when storage limits are approached

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Network Connectivity**: Ensure internet access for feed sources
- **API Limits**: Check API key limits and quotas
- **Storage Space**: Monitor disk space for feed cache
- **Permission Issues**: Verify directory write permissions

### Maintenance
- **Feed Cleanup**: Regular cleanup of old feed data
- **Source Verification**: Periodic verification of feed sources
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize feed processing performance
- **Capacity Planning**: Plan for growing feed data storage needs
